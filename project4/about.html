		<h1 style="font-style:italic">MSI Annual Financial Performance</h1>
		<p>Over the past few years, MSI has demonstrated strong financial growth, particularly during the peak of the global demand for gaming and remote work hardware. In 2020, MSI reported a significant increase in revenue, reaching approximately TWD 146.5 billion, a 21.59% year-over-year growth. This boost was driven by surging demand for gaming laptops, graphics cards, and motherboards amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated digital adoption globally. Net income for the year jumped to TWD 7.96 billion, marking a remarkable 42.46% growth, reflecting both strong sales and efficient cost control.</p>
		<p>The momentum carried into 2021, with MSI reaching a record-breaking revenue of TWD 201.8 billion, a 37.75% increase from the previous year. Net income more than doubled to TWD 16.92 billion, showcasing an outstanding 112.59% increase. This financial success was largely due to continued dominance in the gaming market, strategic pricing, and efficient global logistics during a time when many companies faced supply chain disruptions. MSI’s high earnings per share (EPS), both basic and diluted, reflected increased shareholder value and the company’s strong market position.</p>
		<p>However, starting in 2022, MSI experienced a slowdown, mirroring global market corrections and reduced consumer spending on electronics. Revenue slightly declined by 10.6%, falling to TWD 180.4 billion, while net income dropped to TWD 9.96 billion, a 41.12% decrease compared to 2021. Although 2023 saw a small revenue rebound to TWD 183 billion, profits continued to dip, suggesting a shift in market dynamics and the need for diversification. Despite these challenges, MSI has remained financially stable and continues to invest in innovation, sustainability, and expanding its footprint in professional and creator markets.</p>
